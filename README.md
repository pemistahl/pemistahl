## Hello, thank you for visiting my profile. üññüèªü§ì

My name is Peter. There are actually more people than I thought who have the same first and family name, 
so I bother you with my middle name Michael as well. 
Were [Type O Negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_O_Negative) really so popular back then?
I haven't got a clue...

I hold a Master's degree in computational linguistics from 
[Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/study/programmes/master/lst.html) 
in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. After my graduation in 2013, I decided against a research career
because I like building things that help people now and not in the unforeseeable future.

Currently, I work for [Riege](https://www.riege.com/), a leading provider of cloud-based 
software for the logistics industry. In my free time, I like working on open source projects 
in the fields of computational linguistics and string processing in general.

I have a special interest in modern programming languages and green computing.
I believe that the software industry should make more significant contributions
towards environmental protection. Great advances have been made to decrease
energy consumption and emissions of hardware. However, those are often canceled
out by poorly optimized software and resource-intensive runtime environments.

This is why I'm especially interested in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
which allows writing performant and memory-safe applications without the need for a garbage collector
or a virtual runtime environment, making use of modern syntax abstractions at the same time.

For those of you interested in how Rust and related technology can accomplish the goal of more 
eco-friendly software, I strongly recommend you to read the dissertation 
[*Energyware Engineering: Techniques and Tools for Green Software Development*](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Energyware-engineering%3A-techniques-and-tools-for-Pereira/c0c935db208abb92133c422bf710b53ded2faf84)
published in 2018 by [Rui Pereira](https://haslab.uminho.pt/ruipereira/) at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN)
in Portugal.
